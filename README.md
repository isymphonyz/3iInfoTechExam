# Android Architecture Pattern : MVVM

# Use a Navigation Component for manage fragments

# Use Rx for manage an API

# Use Hilt for DI

# ProductDetailFragment : Show a detail of product that pass from ProductsFragment (In this fragment, it isn't to get the data from the server because the ProductsFragment can pass the data (ProductModel) to this fragment.
